## Introduction

- `OAuth` means **Open Authorization**. it is one approach to user authentication using platforms like `Google, Facebook, Github`
- This is so efficient because it requires the filling of no form
- For example if a button on a website is clicked to request signin by Oauth authentication, a request is sent to the service website, for example Google Auth servers. Then by confirming it, the user allows that website to use their user details saved on the google servers for signing into that website.
- `Passport.js` is used to allow the oauth authentication
